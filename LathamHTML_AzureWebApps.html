<h1>Deployment Slots for Azure Web Apps</h1>

<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>One of the more intriguing features of Microsoft Azure's Web Apps is the use of deployment slots. According to Microsoft Azure Essentials: Azure Web Apps for Developers, "A deployment slot technically is an independent web app with its own content, configuration, and even a unique host name." In prior environments I've managed, deploying staging environments to production can be complex, time consuming and a little risky to roll back. Deployment slots help address all three of these issues. </p>

<p>Delpoyment has come a long way sense I started deploying applications. A click of a button provides a simple and instantaneous method for deploying a staged environment to production. Had deployment slots been around when I started deploying .NET applictions 12 years ago, it would have saved me a lot of late nights.

<h2 id="Ben">Benefits of Deployment Slots</h2>

<p>We've already discussed the ease of deployment and the ability to deploy to a staging environment without impacting production. There are several excellent benefits and use cases for deployment slots, including:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>While independent environments, deployment slots use the same underpinning infrastructure and platform components, which ensures that the user experience in staging is nearly identical to production in terms of performance.</li>
  <li>It is easy to deploy an A/B testing scenario to help measure user preferences and experience. A/B testing, aka testing in production, is a technique whereby different users of a website will be randomly presented with different versions of the site. This allows site owners to gauge different user reactions such as bounce rate, conversion rate, etc.</li>
  <li>An application "warm up" can be performed if your application has lengthy initialization code. This avoids long delays from a cold start for the first uses visiting the newly deployed site.</li>
  <li>One of the more beneficial features from a risk management perspective, is the ability to quickly role back in the event the new version is not working as expected.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
Microsoft has listened to the system administrators, engineers and developers of the IT community and really developed a great product with amazing features in Azure Web Apps.

<h2 id="Ex">Example of a Deployment Slot</h2>
<p>Here is a nice demo that shows how to create a deployment slot:<br>

<h2 id="Con">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Deployment slots are just one more advancement in the world of development and dev ops that help achieve the goal of getting amazing functionality to users in a rapid, secure and stable process. It's pretty cool to see what the last decade has brought us in deployment, I can't wait to see what the next decade brings.</p>
